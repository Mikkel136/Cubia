# Cubia ðŸ§Š
===========

## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Cubia is a pre-configured [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur)-based Minecraft server foundation that aims to improve the Vanilla experience.

Ideal for self-hosters and small communities who trust their members enough to not have to worry about anti-cheats.

A much more performant alternative to Mojang's Realms, that lets you take nearly full control of the game.

### Ease of access
We're currently working on making the setup process as easy as possible. Idealy, anyone with no prior experience should be comfortable setting up, operating, updating and expanding on this foundation.

But right now, we're taking baby steps. Stay tuned!


Why choose Cubia?
------
Inspired by Hermitcraft and Empires SMP, Cubia offer an authentic Vanilla experience with a new layer of creative possibilities. 

...not to mention fun gimmicks, in-game Voice Chat and ***a lot*** of quality-of-life improvements that doesn't sacrafise game balance.

Cubia offers ***experimental*** **Bedrock Edition cross-play support** which is ready-to-go with minimal setup!
